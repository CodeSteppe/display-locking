Browsers often implement a number of features to help the user, as their [User Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent). These features are all built on top of the concept of the declarative DOM representation of a web page. Examples include:

* Find-in-page
* Accessibility
* Anchor link navigation
* Focus navigation
* Automatic translation
* Developer tools
